# Traveling Salesman Problem using Dynamic Programming (Bitmasking)

##  Project Overview

This project implements a solution to the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using **Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking** in C++.It provides an exact minimum-cost solution for small to moderately sized graphs (typically up to 20 cities).The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the objective is to find the minimum cost path that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

This was developed as part of my **Algorithms (CSE 246) course project** at university.

##  Features

- Takes user input for the number of cities and edge weights.
- Uses **bitmasking** to efficiently represent subsets of visited cities.
- Uses **dynamic programming** to store and reuse solutions to subproblems.
- Prevents negative edge weights and self-loops.
- Displays the adjacency matrix before computation.
- Outputs the **minimum cost** required to complete the tour.
